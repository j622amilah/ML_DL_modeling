# EEG_DAD
Database-driven Artifact Detection method for EEG systems with few channels

A MATLAB program that uses z-score to predict if portions of EEG data contain artifacts; a statistical approach for what machine learning models do.

NOTE: The reference dataset called good.mat is not in this repository because it exceeds 25MB.  However, the idea is to create your own reference dataset of EEG activity that is considered acceptable ("good").
