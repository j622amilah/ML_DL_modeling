# Histogram_object_detection
Histogram 2D image tracking

Histogram 2D image tracking written in matlab.  The uploaded version is for real-time image acquisition from a web camera and reading a video file.  The program prompts the user to select a region-two-track in the first video frame, after selection the program tracks the selection region throughout the video.

Parameters can be set to trade-off accuracy for detection speed.

In the process of remaking this program in python, for both real-time image acquisition and reading a video.  And, after coupling this 2D tracking program with neural network identification (similar to tensorflow object detection and yolo methods).

Feel free to use and cite this source.  Best.
