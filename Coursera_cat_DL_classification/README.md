# Coursera_cat_DL_classification
Hand-made deep learning neural network exercise

This is a short example of a hand-made deep learning neural network to predict an the presence of an object in an image, in this case the presence of 'cats' versus 'non-cats'. This exercise is from the Coursera Neural Networks and Deep Learning course. Optimization methods to improve gradient descent, like Adam or initialization of parameters are not used. Just the basic structure of a neural network model are explored.

The purpose of such an exercise is to have a working understanding of how the deep learning models are working on sklearn (from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier), Keras, and Tensorflow.
