QampA
software
is
software>online
that
attempts
to
answer
questions
asked
by
users
QampA
stands
for
question
and
answer.
QampA
software
is
frequently
integrated
by
large
and
specialist
and
tends
to
be
implemented
as
a
that
allows
users
in
similar
fields
to
discuss
questions
and
provide
answers
to
common
and
specialist
questions.
b
There
are
numerous
examples
of
QampA
software
in
both
model>open
and
formats
including
Question2Answer
and

for
Communities
such

QampA
sites.
b
QampA
software
is
often
provided
to
corporate
and
specialist
sites
so
the
site
and
its
users
can
be
asked
questions
as
well
as
provide
or
receive
answers
to
them.
This
kind
of
software
is
particularly
useful
for
responding
to
questions
regarding
specific
industries.
Users
may
learn
by
regularly
answering
questions
or
exchanging
views
with
other
industry
specialists
using
the
website.
b
In
the
late
1990s
a
free
online
service
called
Answer
Point
provided
by
Ask
Jeeves
was
launched
allowing
users
to
ask
questions
and
with
the
help
of
other
people
have
them
answered.
The
slogan
of
the
service
The
Ask

is
the
place
where
you
can

indicated
the
main
function
of
it
which
inspired
the
creation
of
later
QampA
sites.
The
last
archived
version
of
the
Ask
Point
was
from
late
2001
when
it
still
allowed
registration.
b
Since
then
more
and
more
sites
have
begun
to
offer
QampA
services.
Google
launched
its
QampA
service
called
Questions
and
Answers>Google
Questions
and
in
August
2001
which
used
Google
staffers
to
answer
questions
by
e-mail.
A
flat
fee
US$3.00
was
involved
for
an
answer.
In
April
2002
Google
launched
Google
Answers
which
allowed
users
to
post
answers
to
questions
to
replace
its
predecessor.
Google

cost
askers
$2
to
$200
for
an
accepted
answer.
By
late
December
2006
it
was
fully
closed
to
new
activity.
b
In
early
2000s
Yahoo!
launched
its
online
QampA
service
called
Yahoo!>Ask
which
was
later
replaced
by
the
beta
version
of

self-moderation.
b
From
2010
with
the
widespread
use
of
smartphones
and
tablets
there
is
an
increasing
number
of
QampA
sites
that
decide
to
launch
mobile
applications.
Popular
QampA
sites
like
Yahoo!
Answers
and
Quora
have
launched
their
own
mobile
applications.
b
Many
online
QampA
communities
do
not
include
financial
rewards
for
knowledge-contribution
behaviors
or
reputation-ranking
mechanisms
while
also
featuring
no
direct
mutual
interest
between
its
users.
People
are
wondering
about
the
reason
that
motivates
users
to
contribute
their
knowledge
on
the
QampA
software.
Feeling
safe
and
trusting
the
software
and
the
Internet
environment
provides
a
foundation
for
users
to
share
their
knowledge.
People
who
trust
the
software
more
tend
to
be
involved
more
in
question
and
answer
activities.
The
knowledge
contribution
from
others
leads
to
even
more
people
to
share
their
knowledge.
Users
who
read
more
contributed
knowledge
tend
to
contribute
more
generally.
Users
are
also
seeking
recognition
when
they
contribute
knowledge
on
the
QampA
software.
Social
rewards
such
as
approval
status
and
respect
play
a
very
important
role
in
motivating
people
to
contribute
to
the
QampA
software.
bUser
s
eagerness
of
showing
their
knowledge
and
expertise
and
the
potential
chance
of
being
noticed
by
recruiters
also
play
a
role
in
motivating
people
to
answer
questions
and
contribute
questions.

the

An
online
QampA
service
serves
the
public
with
its
ease
of
getting
access
without
temporal
and
spatial
constraints.
The
mechanism
over
all
QampA
services
is
the
same:
Questioners
express
their
information
needs
in
the
form
of
a
question
and
people
experts
or
other
users
in
the
system
answer
those
questions
based
on
their
knowledge.
Online
QampA
service
can
be
classified
into
several
types
in
terms
of
who
answer
questions
and
how
services
maintain
and
control
the
quality
of
information.
Shah
et
al.
2009
classified
online
QampA
service
into
three
categories:
b
The
change
of
QampA
community
features:
Early
definition
described
three
types
of
QampA
Sites:
digital
reference
services
ask
an
expert
service
and
community
QampA
sites.
Ask
an
expert
service
represents
a
technological
and
social
way
of
providing
quality
question
answering
service.
This
service
is
staffed
by
domain
experts.
In
comparison
community
QampA
sites
involved
everyday
users
in
answering
questions
it
largely
increased
the
number
of
contributors.
Established
examples
of
community
QampA
sites
are
Exchange>Stack
and
One
of
the
problems
of
these
communities
is
that
it
is
hard
to
control
the
quality
of
answers
compared
with
ask
an
expert
service.
b
However
in
recent
years
community
QampA
sites
tend
to
embrace
newer
interaction
designs
than
the
other
types
of
QampA
sites
by
providing
features
like
tagging
and
rating
interfaces
RSS
feeds
and
highly
interactive
browsing
and
searching
capabilities.
These
features
used
the
crowd
power
to
evaluate
the
quality
of
answers
and
also
the
reliability
of
the
contributors.
Some
communities
as
tags
the
users
received
highest
votes
in
a
given
domain
as
Excellent
answer
provider.
These
new
features
generally
integrate
some
expert
verification
and
service
into
QampA
community
sites.
b
Social
and
information
structure:
Originally
QampA
communities
had
little
structural
or
role-based
organization.
In
recent
years
some
communities
started
to
form
social
and
information
structures.
This
is
driven
by
the
increasing
number
of
contributors
and
the
adoption
of
new
features
as
mentioned
above.
Research
shows
that
there
are
three
different
connection
networks
or
graphs
inside
communities
such
as
A
graph
connecting
topics
to
users
a
social
graph
connecting
users
and
a
graph
connecting
related
questions.
These
connections
help
users
find
the
topic
that
they
are
looking
for
and
build
a
social
connection
with
people
sharing
the
same
interests.
Also
as
contributors
gather
according
to
a
common
theme
their
votes
help
to
screen
out
the
domain
expert
and
the
high
quality
questions
in
that
field.
The
heterogeneity
in
the
user
and
question
graphs
are
significant
contributors
to
the
quality
of
the
bcommunity
s
knowledge
base.
b
The
social
capital
social
exchange
and
social
cognitive
theories
explain
why
users
may
continuously
contribute
knowledge
to
online
social
QampA
communities.
However
some
potential
users
may
also
feel
hesitant
to
contribute
due
to
fear
of
criticism
from
or
of
misleading
online
community
members
The
contributors
can
have
intrinsic
or
extrinsic
motivation
to
contribute.
Further
the
motivations
to
share
knowledge
can
be
categorized
into
individual-based
and
organization
or
website
based
motivations.
Website
based
motivations
extrinsic
include
rewards
and
incentives
to
the
contributions
like
for
example
upvotes
or
coupons.
Individual-based
motivations
intrinsic
would
constitute
factors
like
a
belief
in
knowledge
ownership
individual
characteristics
interpersonal
trust
and
will
for
justice.
Specifically
two
kinds
of
motivations
drive
people
to
participate
in
online
QampA:
Why
do
people
ask
questions
and
why
do
others
answer
these
questions?
b
Motivation
for
asking:
While
there
are
many
different
ways
of
fulfilling
information
needs
a
large
number
of
people
are
asking
questions
in
online
QampA
services.
What
motivates
people
to
take
advantage
of
those
systems?
And
what
do
users
expect
from
using
these
systems?
Choi
2014
surveyed
200
people
who
actively
asked
questions
on
Yahoo!
Answers
and
asked
them
the
motivations
and
expectations
of
asking
behaviors
in
online
QampA
system.
The
five
most
significant
factors
of
asking
behaviors
in
the
survey
are:
b
Expectation
from
askers:
The
next
step
regarding
the
cycle
of
question
and
answering
behaviors
is
for
askers
to
assess
answers
to
see
if
answers
meet
their
expectations
from
information
needs.
In
the
same
survey
examined
by
Choi
2014
the
most
desired
factor
was
or
alternative
information
4.03
/
followed
by
and
complete
It
is
interesting
that
factors
related
to
information
itself
surpassed
and
emotional
support
2.47
/
which
is
related
to
affective
needs.
b
Motivation
for
answering:
Answering
behaviors
have
raised
curiosity
among
researchers
because
there
is
in
general
no
explicit
compensations
against
the
activity.
Raban
and
Harper
2008
asked
people
who
answered
questions
on
social
QampA
about
the
motivation
of
their
answering
behavior
as
well
in
the
same
survey.
The
top
ranked
motivations
are:
b
QampA
software
uses
a
sourcing
model
called
to
obtain
answers
to
posted
Crowdsourcing
is
the
act
of
outsourcing
work
to
an
undefined
networked
labor
using
an
open
call
for
participation
and
it
is
used
to
support
the
activities
on
most
QampA
software
such
as
Stack
Exchange
Quora
etc..
This
technique
allows
the
user
to
obtain
answers
from
a
large
community
with
lower
costs
and
defect
rates
to
the
developers.
b
The
user
asks
their
question
which
can
be
answered
by
any
member
of
that
online
community.
The
answers
then
go
through
an
assessment
wherein
the
good
answers
are
upvoted
and
the
bad
answers
are
downvoted
by
the
users
or
a
similar
parallel
on
different
platforms.
The
members
of
the
online
community
can
find
a
question
that
needs
answering
to
and
answer
that
question.
b
This
type
of
crowd
participation
in
a
QampA
platform
has
the
potential
to
increase
the
knowledge
of
individual
users
thus
improving
and
speeding
up
their
work
process.
The
abundance
of
information
to
which
users
are
exposed
through
this
system
is
effectively
changing
the
way
people
collaborate
communicate
and
learn
in
online
communities.

b
A
large
number

In
addition
users
of
QampA
software
tend
to
provide

faster.
QampA
software
and
websites
are
considered
forms
