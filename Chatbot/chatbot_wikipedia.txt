A
chatbot
or
chatterbot
is
a
application
used
to
conduct
an
on-line
chat
via
text
or
in
lieu
of
providing
direct
contact
with
a
live
human
agent.
Designed
to
convincingly
simulate
the
way
a
human
would
behave
as
a
conversational
partner
chatbot
systems
typically
require
continuous
tuning
and
testing
and
many
in
production
remain
unable
to
adequately
converse
while
none
of
them
can
pass
the
standard
test>Turing
The
term
ChatterBot
was
originally
coined
by
Loren
Mauldin>Michael
creator
of
the
first
in
1994
to
describe
these
conversational
programs.
b
Chatbots
are
used
in
system>dialog
for
various
purposes
including
customer
service
request
routing
or
information
gathering.
While
some
chatbot
applications
use
extensive
word-classification
processes
language
processing>natural
language
and
sophisticated
others
simply
scan
for
general
keywords
and
generate
responses
using
common
phrases
obtained
from
an
associated
library

In
1950
Turing>Alan
s
famous
article
Machinery
and
Intelligence>Computing
Machinery
and
was
published
which
proposed
what
is
now
called
the
test>Turing
as
a
criterion
of
intelligence.
This
criterion
depends
on
the
ability
of
a
program>computer
to
impersonate
a
human
in
a
real-time
written
conversation
with
a
human
judge
to
the
extent
that
the
judge
is
unable
to
distinguish
the
basis
of
the
conversational
content
the
program
and
a
real
human.
The
notoriety
of
bTuring
s
proposed
test
stimulated
great
interest
in
Weizenbaum>Joseph
s
program
published
in
1966
which
seemed
to
be
able
to
fool
users
into
believing
that
they
were
conversing
with
a
real
human.
However
Weizenbaum
himself
did
not
claim
that
ELIZA
was
genuinely
intelligent
and
the
introduction
to
his
paper
presented
it
more
as
a
debunking
exercise:
In
artificial
intelligence
machines
are
made
to
behave
in
wondrous
ways
often
sufficient
to
dazzle
even
the
most
experienced
observer.
But
once
a
particular
program
is
unmasked
once
its
inner
workings
are
explained
its
magic
crumbles
away
it
stands
revealed
as
a
mere
collection
of
procedures
The
observer
says
to
himself
I
could
have
written
that.
With
that
thought
he
moves
the
program
in
question
from
the
shelf
marked
intelligent
to
that
reserved
for
curios
The
object
of
this
paper
is
to
cause
just
such
a
re-evaluation
of
the
program
about
to
be
explained.
Few
programs
ever
needed
it
more.
b<p>ELIZA
s
key
method
of
operation
copied
by
chatbot
designers
ever
since
involves
the
recognition
of
clue
words
or
phrases
in
the
input
and
the
output
of
the
corresponding
pre-prepared
or
pre-programmed
responses
that
can
move
the
conversation
forward
in
an
apparently
meaningful
way
e.g.
by
responding
to
any
input
that
contains
the
word
b
MOTHER
with
b
TELL
ME
MORE
ABOUT
YOUR
bFAMILY
.
Thus
an
illusion
of
understanding
is
generated
even
though
the
processing
involved
has
been
merely
superficial.
ELIZA
showed
that
such
an
illusion
is
surprisingly
easy
to
generate
because
human
judges
are
so
ready
to
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
when

are
