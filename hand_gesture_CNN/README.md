# hand_gesture_CNN

This is a short exercise of building/appending a CNN database of images, and predicting a type of image (in this case a hand gesture in the image). This exercise is from the Coursera Neural Networks and Deep Learning course. Also, other blogs (https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/hand-gesture-classification-using-deep-learning-keras, https://sandipanweb.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/hand-gesture-classification-using-deep-convolution-and-residual-neural-network-with-tensorflow-keras-in-python/) use the same example for practicing and presenting work.

In this example, I will look at how data padding can help to improve prediction estimates of hand gestures. A portion of the images are rotated 90 and -90 degrees, and added to both the training and test dataset.
