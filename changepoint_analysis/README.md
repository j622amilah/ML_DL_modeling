# Changepoint_analysis

Changepoint analysis is a wonderful and powerful technique to find a critical point in a time-series due to detecting differences in the summed average with respect to the overall average. The technique has been mentioned online and in the paper, Taylor, Wayne A.. “Change-Point Analysis : A Powerful New Tool For Detecting Changes.” (2000).

Below is a bare-bones reconstruction of this algorithm written in Octave, using the data from the above mentioned paper.
