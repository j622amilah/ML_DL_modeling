\PARstart{S}{patial} Disorientation (SD), in aviation, is the failure to perceive orientation, position, or movement. It is caused by multiple factors including environmental references and conditions, experience, and stress. There are diverse types of SD symptoms, ranging from confusion to physical sickness, and currently there is no proven method or solution to prevent it \cite{Bles_2008_SD}, \cite{Gibb_2010_Aviation}, \cite{Perdriel_1980_SD}, \cite{Gillingham_1993_Spatial}, \cite{Previc_2004_Spatial}, \cite{Newman_2007_SD}.  International studies on the frequency and severity of SD accidents show that the cause of 6-32\% of major accidents are due to SD, similarly 15-26\% of fatal accidents are a result of SD \cite{Newman_2007_SD}. Recovery from SD is strongly connected to the pilot's awareness of the situation, and his/her ability to perform corrective control, despite the disorientation, to maintain aerodynamic stability; 80\% and 20\% of SD incidents are caused by unrecognized and recognized situations respectively \cite{Bles_2008_SD}. Current measures to document the occurrence of SD are personal reports of physical and perceptual experiences using questionnaire-based methods; measured human activity is rarely used to monitor the occurrence of SD. Current solutions to minimize and/or prevent SD are : 1) detailed categorization of physiological and environmental situations of when SD is likely to occur, we will call SD use-cases, 2) pilot education about the signs and symptoms of SD per SD use-case and pilot training to fly below physiological thresholds of the human vestibular system  \cite{Gillingham_1993_Spatial}, \cite{Newman_2007_SD}, \cite{Previc_2004_Spatial}. In summary, the current measures and solutions to treat SD do not significantly prevent or minimize the occurrence of SD. Additionally, there lacks general understanding of the onset of SD with respect to orientation, position, and speed using environmental references because it is difficult to label SD and non-SD time periods for time-series human activity measurements during "real-world" applications.

% Human activity recognition definition
% -------------------
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is the research field in which time-series and/or video data are used with Machine Learning (ML) \& Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to predict human activity in unconstrained real-world situations. HAR encompasses three main fields of study: gait monitoring, human pose estimation, human activity recognition. Gait monitoring is the study of the human stride, often using accelerometer and/or gyroscope measures, such that health care rehabilitation and athletic performance performance can be quantified and monitored. Human pose estimation is the quantification and recognition of human action using 2D or 3D cameras, to detect life threatening, abnormal, and/or suspicious behavior. Finally, human activity recognition is the study of human behavior, including physical and long-term habits, using a wide variety of sensors such as accelerometers/gyroscopes, cameras, RFIDs, and environmental measures \cite{Anguita_2012_SVMHumanActivity}, \cite{Dirgova_2022_Wearable}, \cite{Fu_2020_Sensing}, \cite{Von_2017_Sparse}, \cite{Nedorubova_2021_CWT_CNN_HumanActivity}, \cite{An_2021_Mgait} \cite{Xiao_2003_DeepLearning}. We hypothesize that the occurrence of SD can be predicted from human activity measurements as has been proven in the field of HAR. Therefore, in this study we propose a motion detection experiment where SD orientation, position, and speed situations are induced, similar to typical walking and running scenarios in HAR, and human activity of one's perceived position and orientation are measured.

% Current situation of SD research
% -------------------
SD has been investigated in various scientific fields, including aviation, psychophysical human motion detection, control theory, neuroscience, and Neuroergonomics. Depending on the scientific field, the approach to quantify human behavior during the occurrence of SD has been recasted in terms of the field's speciality. From an aviation approach, SD is investigated in terms of use-case where factors (e.g.: environmental, psychological, etc) that give rise to each use-case are studied individually and with respect to each other, with the goal of creating an instruction map of how to behave in a certain manner such that SD is not induced. 22+ SD use-cases have been categorized, including the well-known somatogravic and black-hole illusions \cite{Newman_2007_SD}, \cite{Gillingham_1993_Spatial}.  Identified human physicological vestibular thresholds were typically used to restrict certain flight maneuvers, to reduce the likelihood of SD \cite{Gillingham_1993_Spatial}, \cite{Previc_2004_Spatial}. 

The psychophysical human motion detection approach is to investigate behavioral response during varied situational stimuli for specific SD use-cases, with the goal of understanding the range of human response during isolated or mixed stimulus situations. Results assist with clarifying the instruction map of how to behave to prevent SD, or sensorial solutions are developed to modify human response during exposure to use-case stimuli. For instance, directional perception error was investigated in a realistic helicopter task in which participants were asked to point towards the sky to demonstrate a non-SD state \cite{Cheung_2000_Disorientation}. Similarly, continuous heading detection was investigated using a compensatory task in which perceived heading was measured with respect to a remembered target \cite{Sargent_2008_Disorientation}. Most recently, the individual and interactive influences of optical and gravito-inertial stimuli during simulated low-altitude flight demonstrated the importance of sensory integration effects on height perception using joystick response \cite{Denquin_2021_LAF}. 

The control theory approach to motion detection is to model typical human response during use-case stimuli and compare error between predicted and actual human response. Results assist in real-time monitoring of motion detection \cite{Soyka_2011_Predicting}. Neuroscience and Neuroergonomics approaches measure central nervous system mechanisms, including the brain and electrodermal activity, such that changes in physiological signals can assist in understanding neural mechanisms involved during SD. Insensate, unperceived, and perceived SD occurrence use different neuro mechanisms, thus measuring these neuro mechanisms would allow for detection of SD \cite{Hao_2020_Classification}. 

These different perspectives of studying SD are useful and provide insightful information regarding human response in realistic contexts. However many of the mentioned studies, research SD per use-case instead of trying to identify SD in a generalized manner. We believe that it is possible to measure general human flight activity, like a tracking task signal, and predict the occurrence of SD regardless of an SD use-case context, using HAR modeling methods. HAR has not been applied to the problem of SD in aviation such that SD is recognized and detected using sensor information. However, HAR has been investigated in the field of aviation. Moreover, human activity was the quantification of frequency and location interactions between agents \cite{Fusier_2007_ComplxexActivity}. Pilot activity was measured using hand, arm, and body positional movements' in 3D video images \cite{Ding_2015_Surveillance}.

\indent In this study, we investigated human activity during SD in two-steps: 1) motion perception experimental methods to create a generalized SD occurrence dataset containing a perceptual feedback measure, and 2) statistical and DL methods were used to identify optimal modeling parameters for predicting SD. From a HAR perspective SD can be modeled and predicted in a generalized manner, by measuring a piloting activity measurement like joystick motion or body movement during labeled moments of SD and non-SD; where labeled moments of non-SD are determined based on correct task completed. During the dataset creation phase, we used existing motion detection experimental design methodologies and designed a generalized motion detection experiment. A vestibular whole-body compensatory task in darkness was used to produce realistic motion cues that a pilot might experience, and motion detection behavior was recorded via joystick movements. Two experiments were conducted: rotational and translational motion detection tasks. The rotational and translational experiments administered angular and linear whole-body stimulation, around and along the three Cartesian coordinate frame axes respectively, using a motion simulation system. Participants were given randomized combinations of three parameters that created angular or linear motion stimuli: axis, direction along the axis, and speed. The goal of the dataset creation phase was to create a realistic and diverse dataset of the perceptual joystick motion with respect to the occurrence of SD. The motivation was not to identify vestibular thresholds and report corresponding behavior, but to recreate realistic flight response data in a controlled manner such that states of disorientation could be modeled. 

Next, using the generalized SD dataset, DL methods were chosen for SD modeling because of their reliable and effective predictive capabilities in real-world situations \cite{Dirgova_2022_Wearable, Xiao_2003_DeepLearning}. SD classification analysis included; 1) categorized participant responses into four performance categories, 2) created three semi-supervised SD identification labels from the performance categories, 3) created 29 unique features from the perceptual joystick feedback measure, and 4) compared test set prediction accuracy and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) metrics for five key modeling parameters: feature quantity, model type, dataset general use-case, feature type, and semi-supervised label type. Finally, the relationship between physical sickness symptoms and motion disorientation was statistically investigated with respect to SD labels in order to identify potential physiological markers for SD prediction; physical sickness was quantified using a generalized disorientation test for humans called the simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) disorientation sub-scale \cite{Kennedy_1993_Simulator}, \cite{Bouchard_2007_SimulatorSickness}. We hypothesized that participants who correctly detected motion, implying that they do not have SD, would not have physical sickness. The feasibility of other measures for capturing abnormal piloting activity, signalling the occurrence of SD, are discussed.

% Questionnaire methods were considered to be a reliable measurement for physical sickness because the current aviation approach to measure SD is with questionnaires.
