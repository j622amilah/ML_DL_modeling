\section{RESULTS}
For both rotational and translational experiments, participantsâ€™ detection behavior was quantified using the detection performance categories in terms of count and initial RT with respect to stimulation speed and axis; no significant differences were found between positive and negative axial directions thus directional differences were not considered. As previously mentioned, human motion detection ability of self-motion along axis and axial directions are often reported in terms of motion detection threshold \cite{Valko_2012_Vestibular}, \cite{Hartmann_2014_Direction}, \cite{Karmali_2017_Multivariate}. A motion detection threshold is registered from a self-report that motion was felt along a specific axis and direction for a specific motion stimulus frequency. Results are typically displayed in terms of mean detection count across or per subject for many stimulus motion frequencies, where count results are grouped by successful and unsuccessful detection. We performed the same analysis presentation for our two sub and sup stimulus frequencies, displaying results in terms of count, mean count, and RT across participants, where count and RT results are grouped by detection performance categories.

\subsection{MOTION DETECTION PERFORMANCE}
Figure \ref{fig5} shows the normalized summed count (top row), normalized mean count (middle row), and mean RT (bottom row) per detection performance category, across participants for RO, PI, YA, LR, FB, and UD axes and sub \& sup speed conditions, for both rotation and translation. The top row shows the normalized summed count per detection performance category for each axis and speed condition. For rotation, the summed bars in the top row are equal to 648, which corresponds to the 18 participants multiplied by 36 trials. The top row represents the distribution of total trial responses per response category. Similarly, for translation, the summed bars in the top row are equal to 504 which corresponds to the 14 participants multiplied by 36 trials. The middle row shows the mean count of the same normalized count data across participants. The mean count represents the frequency of selecting a response category across participants. It was necessary to show both mean and total selection count because average axis selection count can not be clearly understood from the total axis selection count; total count gives information about overall participant response and average count gives information about participant tendencies. The bottom row displays the mean RT taken to detect correctly, thus only IC and EC response categories are shown. Bars without error bars indicate a single sample value, or several participants had the same count value. Single-sample bar values may exist due to data elimination during the rigorous standardization process. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and rank-sum tests were used to determine significance such that significant and slightly significant relationships were represented by (* within axis comparison of sub and sup, ** across axes comparison). Bonferroni correction: p < 0.0167 was used as the significance threshold. Detection performance categories above the lower confidence interval, denoted by the solid red line, were considered for statistical comparison across subjects for categories within (e.g.; sub vs. sup) and across axis (e.g.; RO sub vs. PI sub) conditions.

\subsubsection{DETECTION: SPEED COMPARISON (WITHIN AXIS CONDITION)}
There was a slightly significant sub versus sup count difference for the most counted detection performance category for the RO and PI axes, where sup speed resulted in a higher count than sub speed (RO count EC sup vs sub: KS: non-normal distribution, signed-rank: p < 0.001, rank-sum: p < 0.026, n=13; PI count IC sup vs sub: KS: non-normal distribution, signed-rank: p < 0.08, n=18). Slight significance is denoted in the top row of Figure 5, with a single star in purple and blue. There was a similar trend for the YA axis, where the most counted detection performance category, IC, had a higher sup count than sub count. This demonstrates that participants were more accurate at sup speed than at sub speed, regardless of the motion stimulation axis or direction. No significant differences between sub and sup speeds were found in the translational experiment. However, there was a trend for all axes where the most counted detection performance category had higher sup counts in comparison to sub counts. For example, the EC detection performance category for the LR and FB axes and the IC detection performance category for the UD axis had greater sup counts than sub counts. Translational motion sub and sup speed differences were less apparent than in rotational motion due to inner-ear stimulation differences. Reduced speed detection in translational motion are likely attributed to less semi-circular stimulation and delayed otholic signaling in comparison to rotational motion \cite{Angelaki_2008_Vestibular}. Therefore, we suspect that more data was needed for differences to become statistically significant.

\indent Regarding RT differences for the rotational experiment, some detection performance categories had significantly lower RTs for the sup than the sub speed condition. For RO and PI axes, the RT for the most counted detection performance category was significantly lower for sup speed in comparison to sub speed (RO RT EC sup vs sub: KS: non-normal distribution, signed-rank: p < 0.001, rank-sum: p < 0.001, n=66; PI RT IC sup vs sub: KS: non-normal distribution, signed-rank: p < 0.001, rank-sum: p < 0.001, n=65); significance is denoted in the bottom row of Figure 5 with a single star in purple and blue. In summary, we demonstrate that faster sup motion caused more accurate and faster motion detection than slower sub motion. This result has been reported in motion detection literature, thus confirming that the experiments were performed correctly and that the dataset accurately represented human response \cite{Valko_2012_Vestibular}, \cite{Hartmann_2014_Direction}.

\subsubsection{DETECTION: AXES COMPARISON (ACROSS AXES PER SPEED CONDITION)}
The same speed condition and successful response categories denoted by IC and EC were compared across axes, in order to identify task difficulty with respect to the axis, and thus demonstrate that our experimental results were in alignment with psychophysical motion detection findings. Whole-body motion detection literature shows that RO and PI are easier to detect than YA and translational motion. According to a report RO and PI detection thresholds were statistically similar for novices and experts \cite{Hartmann_2014_Direction}. Additionally, RO was reported to be easier to detect than LR, UD, and YA in both non-vestibular and vestibular dysfunction participants \cite{Valko_2012_Vestibular}. Table \ref{table1} depicts significant differences in response count and mean RT for specific speed and axis categories. Category 1 and 2 represent categories with high count or fast RT and categories with low count or slow RT respectively; the first and second p-values correspond to the signed-rank and rank-sum test respectively. Listing significant differences allowed us to rank axis conditions, with respect to motion detection ease and difficulty, and then compare the ranked list with literature reports to confirm correctness of experimental stimuli. Table \ref{table1} shows that, in alignment with literature reports, we similarly found that RO, PI, and FB axial motions were easier to detect than YA, with dependence on speed when considering only correct responses. In particular, successful response category counts for both RO and PI at sup speed were significantly higher than those for YA, and for sub speed FB and PI had significantly higher counts than YA.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\indent Moreover, our results showed functional differences between the RO, LR, \& FB and PI, YA, \& UD tasks. During PI, participants mostly detected correctly (IC) and rarely when they did not detect correctly, they eventually or never corrected. Again in YA, participants often detected correctly (IC), but when they did not detect correctly they did not feel any motion (NR). Similarly in UD participants often detected correctly (IC), and when they did not detect correctly they often eventually corrected; IC was more prevalent when speed was fast. Whereas in RO, LR, and FB, participants could not initially detect the correct axis and/or direction, but they could eventually find the correct axis after several mistakes.

\indent Lastly, task difficulty for within rotational and translational stimulation appeared to be correlated with longer RT. As mentioned in Section \ref{EXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN}, participants were stimulated slower in the rotational task than in the translational task; thus, RT was different for the rotational and translation tasks and were not compared. The second portion in Table \ref{table1} labeled RT, shows the significant within experiment comparison across axes for only correct responses. For the rotational task at sup speed, RO and PI had faster RT than YA indicating that participants needed less time to detect motion for RO and PI. Similarly, for the translational task at sup speed, FB had significantly faster RT than UD.

\subsection{MOTION DETECTION PERFORMANCE RANK}
Including both rotational and translational tasks, the highest rank score was 55 and the lowest score was 11. On average, participants received a rank score of 37. Therefore, the best performer, regardless of rotation or translation, achieved $(55/72) \cdot 100=76.3\%$ accuracy for the task. The average performer was only able to achieve $(37/72) \cdot 100=51.38\%$ accuracy for the task. The same task accuracy statistic was calculated for sub and sup conditions individually, for both rotation and translation experiments, and similar results were found, as shown in Table \ref{table2}. Table \ref{table2} shows the experimental performance accuracy per speed condition using the performance rank measure. All percentages were calculated by dividing by 36 trials.

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{DETECTION PERFORMANCE RANK PER SPEED CONDITION.}
\label{table2}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{C{50pt}|C{30pt}C{40pt}C{25pt}C{40pt}}
\hline
Rank & Rot sub & Trans sub & Rot sup & Trans sup \\
\hline
Best & 83.3\% & 75\% & 80.5\% & 77.7\% \\
Average & 47.2\% & 55.5\% & 55.5\% & 58.3\% \\
Worst & 11.1\% & 0\% & 30.5\% & 25\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These rank statistics show that the detection task was challenging for the average person, regardless of the experimental conditions, but it was not impossible to perform with reasonable success. The participant distribution count for the rotational experiment was five best performers, 11 average performers, and two worst performers. Similarly, the participant distribution count for the translational task was as follows: two best performers, 11 average performers, and one worst performer. The rotational and translational participant distribution counts for best, average, and worst performance were similar, showing that both tasks were similarly challenging in terms of motion detection. Therefore, translational detection may not be more difficult than rotational detection in realistic environments.

\subsection{MOTION DETECTION PERFORMANCE AND PHYSICAL DISORIENTATION}
Twenty of the 31 participants did not feel any difference in terms of physical disorientation during the entire experiment. Considering the performance rank score mentioned in Section \ref{MOTION_DETECTION_AND_PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY}, approximately 1/3 of the average detectors, 1/3 of the best detectors, and 2/3 of the worst detectors experienced physical disorientation. The 2/3 worst detection ratio is reported for completeness; however this measure is disregarded because it is based on only three participants. Thus, 1/3 of the population felt physical disorientation regardless of performance.

\indent To investigate whether there was a relationship between physical disorientation and detection performance, the detection performance of the 12 participants who reported physical disorientation was evaluated; see Table \ref{table3} for a percentage of their summed trial performance per category per SSQ difference report. For instance, a participant who reported a before and after SSQ score of six and four respectively would have their trial performance category counts, of eight EC and six IC trials, associated with an SSQ disorientation difference score of negative two. Table \ref{table3} shows the motion detection response category per reported SSQ disorientation sub-scale difference for both the rotational and translational experiments. Performance category percentage values across SSQ scores sum to 100\%. Negative and positive SSQ values denote that the participant felt better before and after the task respectively. The bold percentages corresponding to negative SSQ values for categories EC and NC highlight that more negative physical disorientation was present in unsuccessful initial attempts to detect motion. Table \ref{table3} demonstrates that more negative physical disorientation was observed for unsuccessful initial detection response categories EC and NC, than for IC successful initial detection response or no response. The negative and positive SSQ disorientation differences per response category were summed respectively, to evaluate significance between IC negative and NC or EC negative. Physically disoriented best performers (IC) did not report significantly less physical disorientation than poor performers.

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{SSQ DISORIENTATION SUB-SCALE PER MOTION DETECTION PERFORMANCE CATEGORY}
\label{table3}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|ccccccc}
\hline
& \multicolumn{7}{c}{\centering SSQ (\%)}\\
Category & -5 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 1 & 2 & 4\\
\hline
IC (1) & 5.4 & 8.4 & 17.8 & 23.6 & 24.5 & 8.9 & 11.5\\
EC (2,4,5) & 10.1 & 12.0 & 29.0 & 26.6 & 14.1 & 2.8 & 5.4\\
NC (3,6,7) & 10.3 & 2.7 & 38.5 & 26.3 & 5.2 & 11.5 & 5.5\\
NR (9) & 0 & 3.4 & 20.8 & 18.7 & 26.0 & 21.8 & 9.4\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\indent In summary, we found no significant relationship between physical disorientation and motion detection. There was only a trend that EC and NC performers, who felt physical disorientation, felt better before the task than after. This implies that participants became fatigued while trying to perform the task, when detection was not easy for them. For IC performers who experienced physical disorientation, there was no trend in terms of feeling better before or after. Implying that participants who could detect easily, felt discomfort for other reasons not related to the experiment. There was a slight trend for NR performers that felt physical disorientation, such that they felt better after the task than before. Showing that participants who did not respond, became comfortable and relaxed in the dark experimental setting.
