    # Created by Jamilah Foucher, FÃ©vrier 01, 2021

    # Purpose: Make a new vector, where entries from an old vector are put for certain indices (given by an index vector).  Put a constant number in the new vector indices, that are not in the index vector.
    #  
    # Input VARIABLES:
    # (1) old_vec is a vector the same size as new_vec, where you only want certain index values to be put in new_vec
    #  
    # (2) index_vec is a vector with index values, to reassign these index values from old_vec to new_vec
    # 
    # (3) const is a constant number
    #  
    # (4) way = 1 or 2  where 1 is a slower way (for loop and if statement), 2 is faster (find function)
    # 
    # Output VARIABLES:
    # (1) new_vec
